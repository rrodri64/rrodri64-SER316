# SER 316 - Java Program Testing

For this course, assignments focused on the application of software processes and best practices during software development.
Each iteration of the ongoing project consisted of implementing software, performing testing (using unit, integration, and
scalability tests), and finally deploying the product on a GitHub repository. Key ideas included: black box and white box testing, 
JUnit tests, code consistency and style using automated tools (namely Gradle with CheckStyle, JaCoCo, and Travis CI extensions), 
documenting metrics, and implementing design patterns.
